            <h1>Full Time Learning Program</h1>
            <h3 id="links">Our Schedule</h3><h3 id="links">Our Faculty</h3>
            <p>Hadar Hatorah, the world's first yeshivah for Jewish men with little or no formal background in Jewish knowledge or practice was founded in 1963. Appreciating the student's past journeys through life, Hadar Hatorah addresses the unique concerns of the sincere latecomer.</p>
            <div id="letter"><p>Dear Prospective Student,</p>
            <p>More than fifty years ago, when Hadar Hatorah was first founded, it was a revolutionary idea for a young man to want to attach himself to a traditional, chassidic lifestyle and join a yeshiva to accomplish these purposes. Nowadays, it is much easier. It is more accepted, more understood but still not necessarily an easy step to take. At Hadar Hatorah, we try to make this transition process as easy and inspiring as possible. One important resource is the community of Crown Heights at large. This includes many of our own alumni, professionals and businessmen, raising families of their own. These individuals are truly a significant resource, providing an example and additional channel for direction for Hadar Hatorah students.</p>
            <p>Most important, however, is the knowledge of Judaism that you, the student will learn and absorb in the yeshiva itself. The process of learning and study is all encompassing, requiring time, patience and determination. It is not only absorbing information, but bringing this information to a level of personal realization.</p>
            <p>Our teachers are here to support you, guide you and answer all your questions, no matter what they might be. Our goal is to guide and educate you to become a practicing and knowledgeable Jew and a Chassid of the Rebbe.</p>
            <p>Whether a man joins Hadar Hatorahâ€™s full-time program for a significant period of time or just for the summer program in the Catskills or even for one of the ten-day YeshivaCations given three times a year, he will surely gain knowledge and love for our holy Jewish tradition.</p>
